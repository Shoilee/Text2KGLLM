        description: >-
            A collection of one or more military posting (event) records,
            each describing when a person joined a military unit,
            in which loaction and with what rank and additional notes.

            militarypostingdetails:
                description: >-
                    A semicolon-delimited list of individual military postings included in this set.  
                    Include all details regarding the military unit, geographic location, time
                    period, rank, and any changes in status, but only those explicitly stated in
                    the text.  
                    If a person held multiple ranks or served in multiple units during the same or
                    different periods, each posting should be represented as a separate entry.  
                    If a posting is mentioned without a location, or a rank is mentioned without a
                    unit, these should still be captured as postings with the missing elements.

                        Produce a semicolon-terminated list of military posting entries.
                        Formatting rules:
                        1. Each posting must appear on its own line.
                        2. Within each posting, items must be separated by commas—not semicolons.
                        3. Each posting must end with a semicolon ";"
                        4. No extra text, no bullet points, no explanations.
                        5. The final output must look exactly like this pattern:

                        militarypostingdetails:
                        <location> <unit>, <rank + start date>, <end date> ;
                        <location> <unit>, <rank + start date>, <end date> ;
                        <location> <unit>, <rank + start date>, <end date> ;

                        6. Do not use semicolons inside a posting except at the end.
                        7. Preserve the original wording exactly as in the input text.
